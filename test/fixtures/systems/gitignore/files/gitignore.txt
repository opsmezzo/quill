<h1>Fry and the Slurm Factory</h1>
<p>OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. A sexy mistake. I'll get my kit! With gusto. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.</p>
<h2>Future Stock</h2>

<h3>A Clone of My Own</h3>
<p>Oh, I don't have time for this.  I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</p>

<h5>Crimes of the Hot</h5>
<p>Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Hey, guess what you're accessories to. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!</p>
